# Toliver Crisp's Personal Portfolio (Challenge #2)

## Description

**- What was your motivation?**

My motivation to complete this challenge was that I was excited to start a website from scratch that represented my programming brand as a developer. Starting from a fresh canvas was, at times frustrating, sure, but overall I feel very accomplished.



**- Why did you build this project?**

I built this project because I wanted to create a online personal portfolio for myself to send to perspective employers during my impending job search. By creating a (somewhat) impressive personal portfolio, I have established myself as a serious candidate in the software development industry.


**- What problem does it solve?**

This project solves a personal problem, that I am sure I share with many of my co-developers in this bootcamp: no one knows who I am in the software development industry. By creating my portfolio, I can now offer it to potential employers to demonstrate my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript capabilities.


**- What did you learn?**

I learned a lot during this challenge, so I will bullet examples below for the sake of brevity.

I learned how to...

- Create more complex hover effects on my links
- Organize the layout of a website from start to finish
- Select an effective and accesible color pallette for my website.
- Manipulate background images in CSS (oh boy, did I do a lot of that)
- Create a hover effect that overlays a slightly translucent linear gradient onto a picture, as well as organize those pictures to the specifications in the example website (This was the hardest thing I had to do.)

Overall, I am quite pleased with this website. I worked really hard on it and I would rather lose some points for the lack of responsiveness (i.e. the webpage doesn't support mobile layouts like iPhones) than reduce the quality of my website.

It certainly is possible to make the webpage responsive to mobile devices, however, in my pursuit of greatness, I trapped myself inside a hellish, waking-nightmare of divs and confusing flex-box properties.

I shall leave that to a better man than I.

(Also, I live in Florida and I've been prepping for Hurricane Ian all day. If there's any slack available in the city of Austin, I would very much appreciate it if you could cut me some of it. Pretty please?)
