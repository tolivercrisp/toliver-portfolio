                    UT Austin coding bootcamp. I grew up in Fairfield, Connecticut until I went to the College of Charleston
                    in South Carolina. I studied English with a concentration in Creative Writing. During my junior year in Charleston,
                    I discovered my interest in software development by messing around with Python. Little did I know,
